## 3. Usage of `setup.sh`

There are two setup scripts in the repository, `setup.sh` and `setup.ps1` for Linux and Windows respectively.
These scripts help in setting up the environment, building, cleaning, running, and deactivating the virtual environment for the project.

### Guide for setup.ps1:

```powershell
.\setup.ps1 {set_env|build|clean|run|deactivate}
```

#### Set up the environment
Sets up the Python virtual environment and installs dependencies.

```powershell
.\setup.ps1 set_env
```


#### Run the project
Runs the `main.py` script with optional arguments. The arguments are passed to the script. *See the usage of the python script.*

```powershell
.\setup.ps1 run [args]
```

#### Deactivate the virtual environment
Deactivates the Python virtual environment.

```powershell
.\setup.ps1 deactivate
```

#### Build the project (into an **executable**)
Builds the project using PyInstaller and creates an **executable** in the `dist` directory.

```powershell
.\setup.ps1 build
```

#### Clean the project
Cleans up generated files and directories such as `dist`, `build`, `.venv`, `__pycache__`, and `main.spec`.

```powershell
.\setup.ps1 clean
```

### Guide for setup.sh:

## 4. Cookies

1. Open the browser and login to `ehall.xjtu.edu.cn`.
2. Rondomly choose a service, such as `个人方案查询`.
3. Click `进入服务` button on the bottom.
4. Now, you can see there are three buttons on the middle of the page: `学生`, `移动应用学生`, `学生组`. You could click any one button that you like.
 （*Sometimes and in some service you choosed in step 2, there are maybe less buttons, but anyway, just choose one of them.*）
5. Press `F12` to open the developer tools, and click the `Application` tab.
6. Click the `Cookies` item on the left, and then click the `https://ehall.xjtu.edu.cn` item.
7. Find the `_WEU` and `MOD_AMP_AUTH` cookies, and copy the value of them to a file. The file should be like this:

    ```text
    _WEU=rpoMoUyzA59m...o24tNX;
    MOD_AMP_AUTH=MOD_AMP_c77e...07e2;
    ```
    * The basic format of the cookies should be `key=value;`
    * Just copy the `_WEU` and `MOD_AMP_AUTH` cookies, other cookies are not necessary.
    * The value of the cookies should be separated by `;`, and space, tab or newline is allowed between the cookies, but not necessary. So just be free to copy the cookies.
    * A simple way to get the cookies is clicking the target cookie, and its cookies value will be shown on the bottom of the pine. You can copy it directly.

8. Save the file to a path, and use the path as the cookies's path in the script.
